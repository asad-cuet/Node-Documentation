There are 3 pattern of relationship:

1. Normalization:
=================
    -> Give consistency
    -> Relation like MySQL
    -> Need extra query


2. Denormalization:
===================
    -> Give Performance
    -> relational data doesn't have external collection.
    -> Store relational data as a object in a key
    -> Doesn't need any extra query

3. Hybrid:
=========
    -> Cobmination of Normalization & Denormalization
