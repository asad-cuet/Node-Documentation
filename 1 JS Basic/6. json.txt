What is JSON?
=============
    -> JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation

    -> JSON is a lightweight data interchange format

    -> JSON is language independent *

    -> JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand

    -> * The JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax, 
         but the JSON format is **text only**.

    -> Code for reading and 
       generating JSON data can be written in any programming language.

JSON Example:
============
    {
        "employees":
        [
            {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
            {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
            {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
        ]
    }

JSON Arrays
============
    -> JSON arrays are written inside square brackets.

    -> Just like in JavaScript, an array can contain objects:

        "employees":[
            {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
            {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
            {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
        ]

JSON.parse():
=============
    -> to convert the string into a JavaScript object

    ->
        const obj = JSON.parse(text);
