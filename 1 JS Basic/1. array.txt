Array Define Ways:
=================
    const points = new Array(40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10);
    const points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10];

    ->These two different statements both create a new array containing 6 numbers

Associative Arrays:
===================
    -> Many programming languages support arrays with named indexes.

    -> Arrays with named indexes are called associative arrays (or hashes).

    -> **** JavaScript does not support arrays with named indexes. *******

    -> In JavaScript, arrays always use numbered indexes.


WARNING !!
==========
    -> If you use named indexes, JavaScript will redefine the array to an object.

    -> After that, some array methods and properties will produce incorrect results.

    -> Example:
        const person = [];
        person["firstName"] = "John";
        person["lastName"] = "Doe";
        person["age"] = 46;
        person.length;     // Will return 0
        person[0];         // Will return undefined
